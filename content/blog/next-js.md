# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful framework built on top of React, providing an easy way to create fast, server-rendered applications. If youâ€™re familiar with React but are looking to improve performance, SEO, or scalability, Next.js is the tool you want to explore.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js offers several key features that make it a popular choice among developers:
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Pages are rendered on the server, allowing for improved performance and SEO.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG):** Build static sites that are fast, efficient, and pre-rendered at build time.
- **API Routes:** You can create serverless API endpoints directly within your Next.js application.
- **File-Based Routing:** No need to configure routing manually. Pages are automatically mapped to routes based on the file structure.

## Setting Up Next.js

To create a new Next.js project, follow these simple steps:

1. Install Next.js and create your project:
  ```bash
  npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
  cd my-next-app
  npm run dev
  ```

2. Open your browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to see your new Next.js app in action.
